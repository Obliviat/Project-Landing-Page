				<h3>Congress Passes Huge Coronavirus Relief Bill</h3>
				<p>
					Congress on Monday night overwhelmingly approved a $900 billion
					stimulus package that would send billions of dollars to American
					households and businesses grappling with the economic and health toll
					of the pandemic.
				</p>
				<p>
					Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said hundreds of dollars in direct
					payments could begin reaching individual Americans as early as next
					week.
				</p>
				<p>
					The long-sought relief package was part of a $2.3 trillion catchall
					package that included $1.4 trillion to fund the government through the
					end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. It included the extension of
					routine tax provisions, a tax deduction for corporate meals, the
					establishment of two Smithsonian museums, a ban on surprise medical
					bills and a restoration of Pell grants for incarcerated students,
					among hundreds of other measures.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though the $900 billion stimulus package is half the size of the $2.2
					trillion stimulus law passed in March that provided the core of its
					legislative provisions, it remains one of the largest relief packages
					in modern American history. It will revive a supplemental unemployment
					benefit for millions of unemployed Americans at $300 a week for 11
					weeks and provide for another round of $600 direct payments to adults
					and children.

			<h3>How to Stop the Mutant Coronavirus</h3>
			<p>
				A new and potentially more contagious variant of the coronavirus has
				been detected in Britain and elsewhere. With the Trump administration
				continuing to do little to address the pandemic, state and local leaders
				have, again, been left to deal with this problem on their own.
			</p>
			<p>
				To that end, on Monday Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York persuaded major
				airlines to require people traveling from Britain to New York to first
				clear a coronavirus test. Mr. Cuomo’s willingness to act quickly and
				decisively here is commendable — refreshing in a year rife with failures
				to do exactly that — and the move seems reasonable in the face of
				federal inaction and many unknowns.
			</p>
			<p>
				But it’s important to understand just how profound those unknowns are,
				and why they exist in the first place. Neither scientists nor
				policymakers have any idea how widespread the variant in question is.
				Did it originate in Britain or migrate there from somewhere else? How
				many other countries is it in? It could already be in the United States
				— in New York — for all anyone knows.

			<h3>America’s Leaders Begin to Get Vaccinated</h3>
			<p>
				Mike Pence will receive a coronavirus vaccine today, in what the
				administration called an effort to “promote the safety and efficacy of
				the vaccine and build confidence among the American people.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Joe Biden will also receive a vaccine soon, possibly next week. Dr.
				Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert, has said
				that like Biden, he will be vaccinated publicly, to demonstrate his
				confidence in the vaccine. And Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority
				leader and a polio survivor, said yesterday that he would receive a
				vaccine “in the coming days.”
			</p>
			<p>
				One of Biden’s closest advisers, Representative Cedric Richmond, began a
				14-day quarantine after testing positive for the virus, according to a
				spokeswoman for the transition. Richmond, who appeared briefly beside
				Biden at an outdoor event in Georgia this week, is the first announced
				member of Biden’s White House staff to report testing positive.

				<h3>
					In a shift, Twitter won’t transfer followers of official White House
					accounts when Biden takes office.
				</h3>
				<p>
					If you follow @POTUS, @WhiteHouse or the other official presidential
					handles on Twitter, you’ll have to re-follow them on Jan. 20 when
					President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. takes office.
				</p>
				<p>
					When President Trump was inaugurated in January 2017, the official
					handles were taken over by the Trump White House with their followers
					intact, at the encouragement of the outgoing Obama administration.
				</p>
				<p>
					This time, however, Twitter will not be transferring the followers
					when those handles shift to the new Biden administration. (@POTUS has
					more than 33 million followers; @WhiteHouse has more than 26 million.)
				</p>
				<p>
					Instead, Twitter said on Tuesday that it would notify users who follow
					the Trump administration’s official accounts that those accounts will
					be archived, and that they can follow the Biden administration’s new
					iterations of those handles if they choose. (Mr. Trump’s
					@realDonaldTrump, which has 88.5 million followers, is a personal
					account and will not be part of the transfer.)
