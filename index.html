						<h3>Trump Impeached for Inciting Insurrection</h3>
						<p>
							WASHINGTON — Donald J. Trump on Wednesday became the first
							American president to be impeached twice, as 10 members of his
							party joined with Democrats in the House to charge him with
							“incitement of insurrection” for his role in egging on a violent
							mob that stormed the Capitol last week.
						</p>
						<p>
							Reconvening in a building now heavily militarized against threats
							from pro-Trump activists and adorned with bunting for the
							inauguration of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., lawmakers
							voted 232 to 197 to approve a single impeachment article. It
							accused Mr. Trump of “inciting violence against the government of
							the United States” in his quest to overturn the election results,
							and called for him to be removed and disqualified from ever
							holding public office again.
						</p>
						<p>
							The vote left another indelible stain on Mr. Trump’s presidency
							just a week before he is slated to leave office and laid bare the
							cracks running through the Republican Party. More members of his
							party voted to charge the president than in any other impeachment.
						</p>
						<p>
							Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, declaring the past week one of
							the darkest chapters in American history, implored colleagues to
							embrace “a constitutional remedy that will ensure that the
							republic will be safe from this man who is so resolutely
							determined to tear down the things that we hold dear and that hold
							us together.”
						</p>
						<p>
							A little more than a year after she led a painstaking, three-month
							process to impeach Mr. Trump the first time for a pressure
							campaign on Ukraine to incriminate Mr. Biden — a case rejected by
							the president’s unfailingly loyal Republican supporters — Ms.
							Pelosi had moved this time with little fanfare to do the same job
							in only seven days.
						</p>
						<p>
							“He must go. He is a clear and present danger to the nation that
							we all love,” the speaker said, adding later, “It gives me no
							pleasure to say this — it breaks my heart.”
						</p>
						<p>
							The top House Republican, Representative Kevin McCarthy of
							California, conceded in a pained speech on the floor that Mr.
							Trump had been to blame for the deadly assault at the Capitol. It
							had forced the vice president and lawmakers who had gathered there
							to formalize Mr. Biden’s victory to flee for their lives.
						</p>
						<p>
							“The president bears responsibility for Wednesday’s attack on
							Congress by mob rioters,” said Mr. McCarthy, one of the 138
							Republicans who returned to the House floor after the mayhem and
							voted to reject certified electoral votes for Mr. Biden. “He
							should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was
							unfolding.”
						</p>
						<p>
							Outside the House chamber, a surreal tableau offered reminders of
							the rampage that gave rise to the impeachment, as thousands of
							armed members of the National Guard in camouflage fatigues
							surrounded the complex and snaked through its halls, stacking
							their helmets, backpacks and weapons wherever they went. Their
							presence gave the proceedings a wartime feel, and evoked images of
							the 1860s, when the Union Army had quartered in the building.

						<h3>
							Working Women of Color Were Making Progress. Then the Coronavirus
							Hit.
						</h3>
						<p>
							For years, the story of working women in the United States has
							been one of slow but steady progress. Against this backdrop, the
							latest monthly employment figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor
							Statistics delivered an acute shock.
						</p>
						<p>
							A net total of 144,00 jobs were lost in December, the clear effect
							of the continuing economic downturn. But while male employment
							increased slightly, 156,000 women lost their jobs, mainly in
							pandemic-hit sectors such as hospitality and education. And since
							the employment of white women actually increased, on net these
							losses fell on women of color.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is the scourge of the pandemic: It is landing multiple blows
							on those least able to bear them, widening inequalities stemming
							from gender, class and race.
						</p>
						<p>
							In recent decades, women in the work force have been on the
							ascent. In the late 1980s, women’s pay rose, on average, from
							about 62 cents for every dollar made by men to 81 cents. Their
							participation in the work force rose to just over 50 percent by
							the start of 2020, from 44 percent in 1972. Fifty-nine percent of
							Black women work, up from about 49 percent at the start of the
							1970s. Similarly, 58 percent of Hispanic women work, up from 41
							percent in 1972.
						</p>
						<p>
							But a sense of precarity always threatened these gains.
						</p>
						<p>
							To understand why, Americans must reckon with the heavily gendered
							nature of the work force. Even in more stable times, jobs
							typically held by women were among the lowest-status and
							worst-paid work. Women, for example, account for about
							three-quarters of workers in education and a majority in food
							services. The December numbers for these sectors were stunning:
							Educational services employment was down by 62,500, while food
							services lost a whopping 372,000 jobs.
						</p>
						<p>
							These losses are unlikely to abate. Meanwhile, nearly
							three-quarters of those working at or below minimum wage in 2019
							worked in services, mainly in food preparation and food service,
							which have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic.

						<h3>
							Don’t Let Trump’s Second Trial Change the First Amendment
						</h3>
						<p>
							As the country reels from the spectacle of a Capitol overtaken and
							top U.S. officials scrambling for their lives, the House voted on
							Wednesday to impeach President Trump for, among other things,
							“inciting violence against the Government of the United States.”
							Lawmakers are right to insist that Mr. Trump pay the highest price
							for fomenting a deadly assault on democracy; he should be
							convicted and banned from holding public office.
						</p>
						<p>
							But in pursuing this vital end, legislators should ensure that
							their extraordinary case against Mr. Trump cannot later be
							construed to broaden the legal definition of incitement in
							general. “Incitement to violence” is a strictly defined legal
							concept that allows speech meeting certain criteria to be punished
							notwithstanding the Bill of Rights. If the closely watched
							proceedings against Mr. Trump can be interpreted as
							precedent-setting insofar as the law of incitement is concerned —
							morally speaking or otherwise — we would risk a perverse result
							whereby those impeaching Mr. Trump for his abuses in office could
							make it more perilous for future dissenters and reformers to hold
							the powerful to account.
						</p>
						<p>
							Incitement is one of several narrowly delineated exceptions to the
							First Amendment; others include libel, slander and what are called
							“true threats.” These categories of harmful expression can be
							punished by the government despite the First Amendment’s expansive
							protection of free speech. The problem is that “incitement,” as we
							use the term colloquially — language aimed to goad others on to
							action — is a much broader concept than what is recognized under
							the law.
						</p>
						<p>
							The legal test for incitement was established by the U.S. Supreme
							Court in Brandenburg v. Ohio, a 1969 case involving a Ku Klux Klan
							leader named Clarence Brandenburg who had urged revenge against
							the federal government but had not prodded his followers to take
							violent action. The Court found that the Ohio statute under which
							Brandenburg had been convicted was unconstitutionally overbroad
							and would deter and punish too much potential speech. The court
							held that for incitement to fall outside the First Amendment’s
							protections, three criteria must be met. First, the advocacy must
							be intended to spur lawlessness; Second, the encouraged
							lawbreaking must be imminent, or about to happen right away.
							Third, the speech must be likely to cause such lawbreaking to
							occur. Before Brandenburg, jurisprudence had defined incitement
							more loosely, permitting restrictions on speech based on a mere
							“bad tendency” to bring about a harm the government had a right to
							prevent.
						</p>
						<p>
							The tighter Brandenburg test reflected a shift toward a wider
							berth for political speech that had begun with Justice Oliver
							Wendell Holmes’s dissent in the 1919 case of Abrams v. United
							States. That landmark case involved a group of immigrants who were
							prosecuted under the 1917 Espionage Act for distributing pamphlets
							opposing U.S. intervention in Russia. Although their conviction
							was upheld, Holmes’s famous dissent introduced the concept of an
							open marketplace of ideas, warning Americans to be “eternally
							vigilant against attempts to check the expression of opinions that
							we loathe.” Holmes’s analysis set in motion a long series of
							decisions that over time expanded protections for activists,
							communists, labor organizers and others voicing controversial or
							dissident opinions.
						</p>

						<p>
							Donald Trump is the first modern president to be seriously accused
							of engaging in incitement himself. At a 2016 campaign rally, he
							badgered the crowd to remove a group of demonstrators, saying “Get
							’em out of here.” The protesters were pushed and shoved and one of
							them was punched in the stomach as he and the others were forcibly
							removed. At that point, Mr. Trump said “don’t hurt ’em.” The
							injured later sued Mr. Trump arguing that he had incited a riot.
							But in September, 2018 a Cincinnati appeals court found that Mr.
							Trump’s “don’t hurt ’em” admonition, even if it seemed like an
							afterthought, meant that he had neither advocated nor intended
							riotous violence.

						<h3>
							What Does a More Contagious Virus Mean for Schools?
						</h3>
						<p>
							It wasn’t until last fall that many parents started to breathe
							easier, as it became clear that elementary schools, at least, were
							not cesspools of infection with the coronavirus. But the alarming
							news of a more contagious version of the virus, first identified
							in Britain, revived those concerns.
						</p>
						<p>
							Initial reports were tinged with worry that children might be just
							as susceptible as adults, fueling speculation that schools might
							need to pre-emptively close to limit the variant’s spread. But
							recent research from Public Health England may put those fears to
							rest.
						</p>
						<p>
							Based on detailed contact-tracing of about 20,000 people infected
							with the new variant — including nearly 3,000 children under 10 —
							the report showed that young children were about half as likely as
							adults to transmit the variant to others. That was true of the
							previous iteration of the virus, as well.
						</p>
						<p>
							“There was a lot of speculation at the beginning suggesting that
							children spread this variant more,” said Muge Cevik, an infectious
							disease expert at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and a
							scientific adviser to the British government. “That’s really not
							the case.”
						</p>
						<p>
							But the variant does spread more easily among children, just as it
							does among adults. The report estimated that the new variant is
							about 30 percent to 50 percent more contagious than its
							predecessors — less than the 70 percent researchers had initially
							estimated, but high enough that the variant is expected to pummel
							the United States and other countries, as it did Britain.
						</p>
						<p>
							Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain had promised last year to
							do all he could to keep schools open. But he changed course in the
							face of soaring infections and buckling hospital systems, and
							ordered schools and colleges to move to remote learning. Other
							European countries put a premium on opening schools in September
							and have worked to keep them open, though the variant already has
							forced some to close.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the United States, the mutant virus has been spotted only in a
							handful of states but is expected to spread swiftly, becoming the
							predominant source of infections by March. If community prevalence
							rises to unmanageable levels — a likely proposition, given the
							surge in most states — even elementary schools may be forced to
							close.
