				<h3>Congress Passes Huge Coronavirus Relief Bill</h3>
				<p>
					Congress on Monday night overwhelmingly approved a $900 billion
					stimulus package that would send billions of dollars to American
					households and businesses grappling with the economic and health toll
					of the pandemic.
				</p>
				<p>
					Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said hundreds of dollars in direct
					payments could begin reaching individual Americans as early as next
					week.
				</p>
				<p>
					The long-sought relief package was part of a $2.3 trillion catchall
					package that included $1.4 trillion to fund the government through the
					end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. It included the extension of
					routine tax provisions, a tax deduction for corporate meals, the
					establishment of two Smithsonian museums, a ban on surprise medical
					bills and a restoration of Pell grants for incarcerated students,
					among hundreds of other measures.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though the $900 billion stimulus package is half the size of the $2.2
					trillion stimulus law passed in March that provided the core of its
					legislative provisions, it remains one of the largest relief packages
					in modern American history. It will revive a supplemental unemployment
					benefit for millions of unemployed Americans at $300 a week for 11
					weeks and provide for another round of $600 direct payments to adults
					and children.

				<h3>How to Stop the Mutant Coronavirus</h3>
				<p>
					A new and potentially more contagious variant of the coronavirus has
					been detected in Britain and elsewhere. With the Trump administration
					continuing to do little to address the pandemic, state and local
					leaders have, again, been left to deal with this problem on their own.
				</p>
				<p>
					To that end, on Monday Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York persuaded major
					airlines to require people traveling from Britain to New York to first
					clear a coronavirus test. Mr. Cuomo’s willingness to act quickly and
					decisively here is commendable — refreshing in a year rife with
					failures to do exactly that — and the move seems reasonable in the
					face of federal inaction and many unknowns.
				</p>
				<p>
					But it’s important to understand just how profound those unknowns are,
					and why they exist in the first place. Neither scientists nor
					policymakers have any idea how widespread the variant in question is.
					Did it originate in Britain or migrate there from somewhere else? How
					many other countries is it in? It could already be in the United
					States — in New York — for all anyone knows.

					Stripped of Twitter, Trump Faces a New Challenge: How to Command
					Attention
				</h3>
				<p>
					His public persona was a product of television for decades.
				</p>
				<p>
					Through “The Apprentice,” he built a fantasy version of himself as a
					tough-minded chief executive of a global business empire and a
					self-made billionaire. His wrestling match-style rallies helped him
					dominate television during the 2016 presidential campaign. Ever
					attuned to how he was playing and the power of ratings, he personally
					chose which anchors he wanted to interview him, and persuaded hosts to
					allow him to simply phone into their Sunday shows.
				</p>
				<p>
					But as his campaign played out and his presidency began, Donald J.
					Trump, the master of the small screen, evolved gradually into a
					different character, @realdonaldtrump, whose itchy Twitter finger
					became many things at once: an agenda-setter for the day’s coverage, a
					weapon against his rivals, a way of firing aides and cabinet
					secretaries, a grenade he could throw at Republican lawmakers who had
					crossed him and reporters whose coverage he hated, a window into his
					psyche, and most of all, an unfiltered pipeline to his supporters. One
					of Biden’s closest advisers, Representative Cedric Richmond, began a
					14-day quarantine after testing positive for the virus, according to a
					spokeswoman for the transition. Richmond, who appeared briefly beside
					Biden at an outdoor event in Georgia this week, is the first announced
					member of Biden’s White House staff to report testing positive.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, his Twitter account yanked away from him permanently, President
					Trump faces the challenge, for both his remaining days in the White
					House and in a post-presidency, of how to thrust himself into the
					conversation on his own terms.
				</p>
				<p>
					He spent the first weekend of his presidency without his Twitter
					account cycling through fury and acceptance, ultimately telling people
					he was fine without it. He maintained that being “silenced” would
					infuriate his supporters.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even without Twitter, and even under a new threat of impeachment, Mr.
					Trump remains until Jan. 20 the most powerful man in the world, with
					access to the White House briefing room, the East Room and the Oval
					Office to communicate his thoughts. He has a press office devoted to
					issuing his statements and a cadre of reporters assigned to cover what
					he says and does.

				<h3>
					In a shift, Twitter won’t transfer followers of official White House
					accounts when Biden takes office.
				</h3>
				<p>
					If you follow @POTUS, @WhiteHouse or the other official presidential
					handles on Twitter, you’ll have to re-follow them on Jan. 20 when
					President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. takes office.
				</p>
				<p>
					When President Trump was inaugurated in January 2017, the official
					handles were taken over by the Trump White House with their followers
					intact, at the encouragement of the outgoing Obama administration.
				</p>
				<p>
					This time, however, Twitter will not be transferring the followers
					when those handles shift to the new Biden administration. (@POTUS has
					more than 33 million followers; @WhiteHouse has more than 26 million.)
				</p>
				<p>
					Instead, Twitter said on Tuesday that it would notify users who follow
					the Trump administration’s official accounts that those accounts will
					be archived, and that they can follow the Biden administration’s new
					iterations of those handles if they choose. (Mr. Trump’s
					@realDonaldTrump, which has 88.5 million followers, is a personal
					account and will not be part of the transfer.)
